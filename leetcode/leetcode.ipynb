    "order_map: A dictionary that maps each character to its index in the order string. For example, if order = \"hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz\", then 'h' -> 0, 'l' -> 1, and so on.\n",

    "If a character in word1 is smaller than the corresponding character in word2 (using the alien order), the first word is considered smaller, and the function returns True.\n",
    "If a character in word1 is larger, the first word is considered larger, and the function returns False.\n",
    "If all characters are the same up to the length of the shorter word, the shorter word is considered lexicographically smaller, which is why we return len(word1) <= len(word2).\n",
